							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The first thing to do before you design is identify your puropse, that is, what you want to convey to your audiance. Then you can start to research fonts that were made for that purpose and fit the audiance you hope to reach. Resources like typewolf can help you find good font paring so that you can use more then one font that go well together, usually you want no more then 3. Putting time into your font choices can make or break your website! </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I like that this article had some useful links to font related resources like " The 100 Best Free Fonts" which I will actually use in the future. Like always I am a visual persion and I like all the pictures that showed examples of what the article was trying to show. I had no idea how important fonts were in design I guess I always took it forgranted but this article was very illuminating! </p>
