						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that the idea that making a website accessible has to be difficult and expensive is a myth. There are free and simple tools like  AXE Chrome Extension that can help you make your site accessibile. That being said it is better to think about accessibility before you make your site if you can as fixing the mistake can be harder to fix in a site that already exists.  </p>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I love that this article included tools to help solve the problems that they introduced. One tool I liked and added to my browser was AXE Chrome Extension. I saw also in lecture that Asia mentioned that this was a good tool for determining if a site is accessible so I thought I would give it a shot. </p>
