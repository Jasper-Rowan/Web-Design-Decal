                            <p> The designs are really clean. I learned that I like simple minimal designs. I also learned that I like images in my UI's. </p>

                            <p> I liked seeing all the different UI's. Some of them had to be perchuased so I didnt get to see them all because the for sale ones were greaded out. I really liked what I saw however and I look forward to useing GIFs in my UI design.  </p>

                            <p> My favorite insperation was Welcome screen / login by Andrej Radisic. I really like that it had a real image moving in the background almost like a video but better. The animation that came as the keyboard was awesome and I would really like to learn how to do this myself. I also like the minimal aestheic of this insperation. </p>
