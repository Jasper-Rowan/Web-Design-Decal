							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Elements arranged close to each other are perceived as more related than those placed further apart. So if we wnat to make elements seem related to eachother we can achieve this by putting them close to each other. Also I learned that when presented with the right amount of information, our brain will jump to conclusions by filling in the gaps and creating a unified whole. This way we can decrease the number of elements needed to communicate information, reducing complexity and making designs more engaging. I find this very interesting and always kind of knew that this was the case but it is really cool to know there is some science behind it. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the translation of psychological princibals into concrete design guidlines that I can use in my projects. Like I have said before, I am a visual learner and I really respond well to all the visuals in this blog. I also liked that I learned about both design principals and psycological studies and how they are realated to one another. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "There are different ways of making elements perceived as being similar, and thus, related. These include similarity of colour, size, shape, texture, dimension, and orientation; with some of them being more strongly communicative than others (ex. colour > size > shape). When Similarity occurs, an object can get emphasised by being different from the rest; this is called ‘Anomaly’ and can be used to create contrast or visual weight. It can draw the user’s attention to a specific piece of content (focal point) while assisting with scanability, discoverability and the overall flow." </p>
