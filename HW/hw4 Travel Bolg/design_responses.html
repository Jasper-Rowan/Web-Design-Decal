							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that to meet W3Câ€™s minimum AA rating, your background-to-text contrast ratio should be at least 4.5:1. I had no idea there was an actual contrast cutoff for text with backgrounds but it totally makes sense. Luckly the article also provided recources like colorsafe for picking the right colors for your website. </p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked learning about the website colorable. I followed the provided link to the website and was able to use the sliders to mess around with different text background combos. The other website colorsafe is also a great resource I will use in the future. </p>
